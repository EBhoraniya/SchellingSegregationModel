The test.m file is the one which runs the simulation.
The parameters that needs to be changed in the file are:
-   h_threshold, fraction of like neighbours required by the agents to be happy
-   r_prob, the probability by which a happy agent relocates
-   red, percentage of the red population out of remaining cells
-   empty_p, percentage of empty cells in the m*n grid
-   var which denotes which variant of the relocation is to be used 
    Use var = 1 for modeified Schelling's Model and var = 2 for Schelling's Model
